For my website I want to create the life of the musical artist Tyler, the Creator in a webstie. My title page will have pictures and other elements to make the page pop. After I will transition to his life and how he gained all his fame and become one of the best musical artists of todays generation. Towards the end I will show what he is doing today and will include pictures from his concert that I went to. I want people to know about Tylers life and how he grew to fame. My project will be 4 pages with a lot of pictures and videos.
